# Flower Image Classifier Neural Network

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, it is first developed the code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then it is converted  into a command line application.

The project is divided in two parts: 
* In this first part of the project, I work through a Jupyter notebook to implement an image classifier with PyTorch.
* In the second part, I've built and trained a deep neural network on the flower data set, and converted it into an application that others can use. The application is a pair of Python scripts that run from the command line.


For testing, you it was used the checkpoint I saved in the first part.
